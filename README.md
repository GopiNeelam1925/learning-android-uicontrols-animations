# COMP 304 - Mobile Application Development Fall2018
## Lab Assignment #3
The purpose of this lab assignment is to:
- Develop Android Apps that contain Graphics and Animations
- Practice the use of frame-by-frame animations
- Practice the use of tweened animations

## Exercise 1 (4 marks)
Create an activity that allows the user to draw continuous horizontal or vertical lines, starting from a given position, using up, down, left, and right **keys of Android keypad** as well as **image buttons in UI**. Use a Canvas object to implement the drawings.

Allow the user to choose *colors* and the *thickness* of lines. Allow the user to *clear* the drawings and *restart*. Use code from CanvasPaint example from lecture 5 examples.
The image buttons for arrow keys are provided on eCentennial.

## Exercise 2 (3 marks)
In this exercise you will develop a frame-by-frame animation. Create a series of pictures that differ slightly from each other. Your animation should be original, relate to things that you like or express an idea of yours. Allow the user to start and stop the animation. You may use code from FramedAnimation example of lecture 6.

## Exercise 3 (3 marks)
In this exercise you will create a tweened animation similar to TweenActivity from Lecture 6 examples (AnimationsExample). Create an application to simulate an earth view. Display a png image of the earth and the moon image slightly above the earth image. Apply the necessary transformations (*rotate, scale, translate*) to make the moon revolve nicely around the earth. Define tweening transformations as XML resource files. Allow the user to start and stop the animation.

## Evaluation
